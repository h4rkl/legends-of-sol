# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which PlusOne collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the PlusOne mobile application (“Application”). This privacy policy applies to the Application and all products and services offered by PlusOne.

## Information Collection and Use

We collect information from Users in several ways, including, but not limited to, when Users use our Application, register on the application, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Application. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, twitter handle and profile information. Users may, however, visit our Application anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Application related activities.

We may use the information Users provide about themselves when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service.

We may use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email or User may contact us via our Application.

We use the twitter handle and profile information to allow Users to login to our Application and share a link with other twitter users they follow. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service.

We may use the information Users provide about themselves to improve our Application and services.

## Security

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Application, your information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever we collect sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

## Changes to this privacy policy

PlusOne has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.

## Your acceptance of these terms

By using this Application, you signify your acceptance of this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Application. Your continued use of the Application following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
